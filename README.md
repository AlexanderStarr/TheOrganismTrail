# The Organism Trail

## Installing and Running

1. Ensure that Pygame is installed:
	- On the command line, type "python" and hit enter.
	- Type "import pygame" and hit enter.
	- If you receive no errors, then Pygame is installed.
	- Otherwise, you will need to install Pygame from [here](http://www.pygame.org/download.shtml).
2. On the command line, change the current directory to the game folder.
3. Type "python main.py" and hit enter.

## Playing the Game

### Adding Operons

Operons are segments of DNA which achieve a specific function and provide regulation of that function.  The operon functions included in this game are:

- Passive transport: Also called channels, these allow resources to enter or exit the cell as long as the concentration is lower on the other side.
- Active transport: Also called transporters, these use ATP to move a resource regardless of the concentration gradient.  If a cell has both passive and active transport for the same resource, then it will try using passive transport first.
- Reaction catalysis:  Uses enzymes to increase the rate of a chemical reaction, converting a set of reactants to products.  There are a multitude of possible reactions.
- Attribute modification: Other operons can increase cold or heat tolerance, motility, predation ability, etc.

You will want to add operons according to the environment you have chosen.  Some of them will be needed regardless of the location.  Brush up on your basic biology to determine what will produce a viable organism.

Adding operons increases the size of your organism's genome, which will decrease the rate at which they can multiply.  There is a way to increase the speed of your bacteria's division, but you must use your critical thinking to figure it out!

To add an operon to your organism, click its name on the right-hand side of the screen.  It will appear on the left side, indicating the addition.  You may add multiple of the same operon, but currently this is only useful for DNA polymerase.  To remove an operon that you have added, you may click its name in the left-hand column.

Once you have added all of the operons that you want, click "Go!"

### The Growth Screen

The growth screen displays the time elapsed, and the number of cells that you have.  Each organism you create starts out with 100 cells, and will divide as long as there are no resources limiting it.

Click "Play" to see how your organism fares!  You can see how well your organism grows.  The game stops if your organism stops growing, or you reach the time limit of 3 hours (180 minutes).  Try to see how many organisms you can get before the time limit is up!
